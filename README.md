## Project Overview

This research project explores the relationship between government revenue and access to public education across U.S. states between 1992 and 2018. Using econometric analysis, the study evaluates whether increased government revenue effectively enhances public education expenditure and, consequently, access to education.

## Objectives

1. **Assess Efficiency:** Evaluate how changes in government revenue impact public education expenditure.  
2. **Measure Effectiveness:** Identify the marginal propensity of government revenue to increase education access.  
3. **Policy Implications:** Provide evidence-based recommendations for improving education funding strategies.

## Methodology

### Data
- **Source:** Annual Survey of State Government Finances (1992–2018), Kaplan (2018).  
- **Scope:** Panel data covering 50 U.S. states across 27 years.  
- **Key Variables:**
  - Total Government Revenue (USD)
  - Education Expenditure (USD)
  - Debt at the End of Fiscal Year (USD)
  - Expenditures Excluding Education and Public Welfare (USD)

### Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** 
   - Addressed inflation inconsistencies and standardized variables to focus on ratios.
2. **Statistical Tools:** 
   - Software: STATA
   - Regression Models: Simple Linear Regression, Time/State Fixed Effects, Interaction Terms
3. **Specifications:**
   - Base Case: Examined direct correlation between revenue and education expenditure.
   - Extensions: Controlled for debt, other expenditures, and political leanings to refine results.
4. **Evaluation Metrics:** Robust standard errors, R² values, and statistical significance tests.

## Key Findings

1. **Economic Impact:**
   - Marginal propensity to spend on education from total revenue is 0.0283 (Specification 5), indicating inefficiency.
   - Policies targeting overall spending are more effective than revenue-focused strategies.  

2. **Statistical Significance:**
   - Results vary based on controls, with political leanings and other expenditures significantly influencing outcomes.

3. **Policy Insight:**
   - Increasing government revenue alone is not sufficient to enhance education access effectively; reforms in spending priorities are necessary.

## Limitations

- **Omitted Variable Bias:** Lack of data on potentially confounding variables, such as income levels and education quality indicators.
- **Causality vs. Correlation:** Results are correlational due to violations of least squares assumptions.
- **Per-Capita Analysis:** Total revenue and expenditure trends may differ when analyzed on a per-capita basis.

## Deliverables

1. **Research Paper:** Comprehensive analysis and findings, submitted as part of ECO375.  
2. **STATA Scripts:** Used for data cleaning, regression analysis, and model evaluation.  
3. **Visualizations:** Tables and figures summarizing key statistical relationships.
